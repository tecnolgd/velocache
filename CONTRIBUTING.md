## Contributing to velocache
Thank you for your interest in contributing to velocache! We aim to build a high-performance, minimalist cache engine with a focus on efficiency.

Whether you’re fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or optimizing data structures, your help is welcome.

### Development Setup
To set up your local development environment and build the project, please follow the installation instructions in the [README.md](README.md#installation--build).

*Additional Dev Note: Ensure you have `g++` or `make` installed, as our build process relies on standard GNU tools.*

### Development Workflow
- **Code Style:** Keep it clean and readable. Use standard C++17/20 practices.
- **Performance:** velocache’s core goal is low overhead. Any new feature should have a minimal footprint on system resources.
- **Testing:** If you add a new feature or benchmark, make it modular and ensure it does not break the main server, cache, or storage paths.

## The Required Contribution Workflow
To keep the codebase stable and ensure your time isn’t wasted, all contributors **must** follow this exact workflow. Pull Requests that skip these steps will be closed without code review.

### 1. Find or Open an Issue First
- Do not write code or open a Pull Request out of nowhere.
- Look at our [Open Issues](https://github.com/tecnolgd/velocache/issues) tab. If you find a bug or a feature you want to tackle, comment on that specific issue stating your intent to fix it.
- If you have a new idea, open a new issue first to discuss the architectural impact with the maintainers.

### 2. Wait to be Officially Assigned
- **Do not start working until a maintainer officially assigns the issue to you.**
- We will not accept PRs from unassigned contributors. This prevents multiple people from accidentally working on the exact same file at the same time.

### 3. One Branch, One Pull Request
- When you are ready to submit, use standard keywords in your PR description to link your work (e.g., `Closes #30` or `Fixes #30`).
- **Do not open duplicate Pull Requests.** If you need to fix your code, update your existing branch and push the new commits to your fork. The original Pull Request thread will update automatically.

### 4. Code and Communication Standards
- **Language:** All source code, terminal logs, pull request descriptions, and in-line code comments **must be written in English**.
- Keep pull request descriptions clean, formatted, and focused entirely on the issue layout.

### Current Priorities
